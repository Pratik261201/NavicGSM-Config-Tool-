Great! Here's a **complete `README.md`** file for your `navic_receiver` folder that documents your Python code for receiving and identifying NavIC signals from a GNSS module.

# üì° NavIC Signal Receiver (Python)

This module provides a Python-based solution to read and process NavIC (IRNSS) satellite signals using a GNSS module that supports `$PIRNSF`, `$GNGGA`, `$GNGLL`, `$GNRMC`, and `$GIGSV` NMEA sentences.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

- A GNSS module that supports IRNSS (NavIC), such as u-blox M9N, Quectel L76K, or equivalent.
- USB to serial cable (or UART connection to Raspberry Pi/ESP32).
- Python 3.7+
- Libraries:
  ```bash
  pip install pyserial
````

## üöÄ Usage Instructions

1. **Connect your GNSS module** to your PC via USB or serial UART.
2. **Edit serial port settings** in `navic_receive.py`:

   ```python
   SERIAL_PORT = "COM3"     # Windows: COMx, Linux: /dev/ttyUSBx or /dev/ttySx
   BAUD_RATE = 9600         # Usually 9600 or 115200 depending on your module
   ```
3. **Run the script**:

   ```bash
   python navic_receive.py
  
4. The terminal will output real-time NMEA sentences.

   * Look for `$PIRNSF` or `$GIGSV` entries indicating active NavIC satellites.

## üîç How to Identify NavIC Signals

* NavIC (IRNSS) satellites are typically shown in NMEA `$GIGSV` or `$PIRNSF` sentences.
* Satellite IDs specific to NavIC usually fall in the PRN range: **R01 to R09**.
* Example line:

  ```bash
  $PIRNSF,10,4,8B,1F,70,...
  

---

## üìÑ Customize the Script

You can modify `navic_receive.py` to:

* Log data to a CSV or text file.
* Filter only NavIC-related sentences.
* Send data to a dashboard or web server.
